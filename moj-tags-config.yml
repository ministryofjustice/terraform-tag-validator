# Optional: Exclude specific resources from validation
#
# Use this ONLY for resources that:
# - Are auto-created by AWS (backups, snapshots)
# - Cannot be tagged due to AWS limitations
# - Are managed outside your terraform codebase
#
# If a resource is in your terraform code, TAG IT (including state buckets).
# Cost allocation requires all infrastructure to be tagged.
exclude_resources:
  # Example: Exclude AWS-managed backups (uncomment if needed)
  # - "*.backup_*"
  # - "*_backup"
